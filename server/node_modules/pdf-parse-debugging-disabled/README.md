# pdf-parse-testing-disabled

Original package is [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse).

I've been getting the following error, which I found out to be originating from the debugging mode of the package.

```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
```

So I changed the package's `index.js` file to set `isDebugMode` to `false`.
